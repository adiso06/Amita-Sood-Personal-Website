Ms. 123au, I’m the owner of that property and Amita was representing us to get the house rented. I’ve known Amita for more than 7 years and worked with her on multiple property dealings. Let’s not be quick on jumping to conclusion and tarnish the reputation built over years of hard work while delivering excellent service with successful results. Let me share my view of this story on this forum. Whenever multiple young people are sharing the house, the landlord needs to be extra cautious. We were happy to review your application along with other tenants and looking forward to giving you the opportunity for the rental and Amita recommended highly about you ladies. It took us few business days to narrow down the lease application of all parties involved in the roommate tenants situation and we also wanted ensure that all the parties are protected along with adhering to HOA guidelines. Amita informed us that she discussed all the lease terms with you verbally. Additionally your father also called her and had a good discussion. Later, when Amita reached out to you, it appeared that you had some uncertainty and demanded a week to review the lease with your room mates. We could still accept 24-48 hours to review the lease, however you and your room mate spoke rather rudely to Amita, about not getting a week to review the lease. A week to review the lease means that we keep the property off market for a week while we wait for you to revert with an answer. Finally, you also confirmed not to proceed further since all parties were not able to come to terms with this timeline. The property has already been rented. The listing may not have been updated with the right status. Be wary before venting yourself online as it spoils others reputation for no fault of theirs. We wish you the best and hope you find the right rental for you. Peace!

Amita has been an excellent agent who has helped me rent my property over many years. She has kept my interests as landlord in focus and guided through multiple application processes. She is knowledgable, speaks clearly and above all is a fair person whose careful approach has given me many longer term tenants. I strongly recommend her.

I had an experience similar to another person in 2016, seems like there's a pattern here! Here's my 2024 experience with Amita Sood. We had negotiated the terms of a lease and agreed to the landlord's conditions after some initial back and forth. Ani...
