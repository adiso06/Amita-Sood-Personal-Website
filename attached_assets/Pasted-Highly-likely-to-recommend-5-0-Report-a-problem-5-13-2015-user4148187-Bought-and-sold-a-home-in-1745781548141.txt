Very pleasant, professional, patient and knowledgeable! Never pushy or hurrying to close a sale, at the same time very clear about timeline implications - a rare quality in today's agents. We are very happy to have her as our agent.

I could begin by saying that Amita is a lovely human being.She has good knowledge of the market.She is very aggressive and does everything in her stride to make things happen .i found her different because she is very transparent in her dealings puts forth the options but doesn't pressurise. Besides helping me find the perfect home she has helped me find my way around in an absolutely new city.God bless her.

Amita is a wonderful to work with. First of all, she knows our local real estate market and surrounding communities very well. She successfully deals with all the parties involved professionally and competently, while putting her clients' interests first. She also gets that a home decision is a very important yet personal issue, and while she does provide the necessary expertise, she patiently answers any and all questions. Most important of all, she is trustworthy, ethical and honest. I highly recommend Amita!

Amita Sood responded to our call immediately and helped us rent a house in less than a week's time. Last year when we started searching house to buy, she was quick to send us the listings and showing the houses . she helped us in everything during the process of buying -right from negotiating , inspection of the house, bank loans - until the closing . She is the best in her field , very thorough and quick in her work and gives genuine advice to her clients .

Totally impressed with the service. She was always there to help us in every step of the process, from selection to negotiation to mortgage to closing. She treated us more like a family than clients. She even helped us with the children's classes. She is the best realtor we have seen so far.
